Note: This Repository is part of my Git Mastery Challenge.

### Summary of My Git Mastery Challenege
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Git concepts and workflows.
Throughout the challenge, I explored various phases ‚Äî from cloning and setting up repositories, managing branches, merging, resolving conflicts, stashing, rebasing, cherry-picking, to handling bad commits and recovery with reflog. I also learned how to maintain documentation, update changelogs, and follow clean commit practices. This journey gave me practical experience with real-world Git scenarios and boosted my confidence in using Git for collaborative software development.
